## Description

This application allows the user to quickly create a README file for their project using **only** the command line to answer prompts with their info. When all questions are completed, the application will produce a markdown (README.md) file (including a license badge!) with the data the user has entered.

## Installation

This app runs in the command line of a terminal interface, so git bash, Terminal, or VS Code (with Integrated Terminal) is required. Node.js (available for free download here: https://nodejs.org/en/) with the inquirer package installed (using the command "npm install inquirer") is also needed. 

## Usage

I've created a video demonstrating how to use this application which can be found at this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c0atWuq8UzqA4vgMXr_AFJyZ9FLzLvwx/view

The command to initiate the app looks like this:
